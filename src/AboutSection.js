      <p>
        I am a passionate Front-End Developer with a strong focus on creating intuitive web interfaces. With a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, 
        JavaScript, and React.js, I enjoy bringing designs to life and creating 
        user-friendly experiences. I am trying exploring new technologies and 
        working on projects that challenge my skills and creativity.

      <p>
      Currently, I am focused on mastering front-end development, particularly React.js. Once I have achieved proficiency in front-end technologies, I plan to dive into backend programming and explore the MERN stack to become a full-stack developer.
